Komunikaty ostrzegawcze:
1: pakiet ‘hBayesDM’ został zbudowany w wersji R 3.4.4
2: pakiet ‘Rcpp’ został zbudowany w wersji R 3.4.4
3: There were 2 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.95 may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup
4: There were 3 transitions after warmup that exceeded the maximum treedepth. Increase max_treedepth above 10. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#maximum-treedepth-exceeded
5: There were 1 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bfmi-low
6: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
